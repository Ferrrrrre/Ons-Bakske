# Ons-Bakske
We all have a network of friends or interesting people we've met. But networking is not always that simple or not something for everyone. Andries and I were such people during our first network event, so when we needed to tackle a certain problem connecting both the online and the offline world, we chose this. How do we network, what do we talk about? Those were the questions we hoped to answer with our project.

# Ons bakske

Introducing "Ons bakske", a blue little box that in exchange for your and a partner's mobile rectangle provides you with a topic to discuss.
So this box could be placed at networking events and all sort of people could place their smartphone on it, as soon as two people have done this, the screen lits up and show you a conversation topic as along as your phones are there.
And so people could network even easier!
